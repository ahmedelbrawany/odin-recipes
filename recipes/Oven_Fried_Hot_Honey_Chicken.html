        <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts (cut in half) or thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>3 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons table or sea salt</li>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>2 jalapenos, stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons smoked or regular paprika, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>Pinch table or sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li><h3>Marinate the chicken</h3></li>
       <p>In a large zip top plastic bag, add the chicken, buttermilk, and salt. Seal the bag tightly and massage the buttermilk into the chicken. Refrigerate the chicken for 30 minutes or up 24 hours. </p>

       <li><h3>Preheat the oven</h3></li>
       <p>Set the oven rack in the center and preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and generously spray it with cooking spray. Set it aside.</p>

       <li><h3>Prepare the breading</h3></li>
       <p>In a large bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, flour, and salt. Set it aside.</p>

       <li><h3>Dredge the chicken</h3></li>
       <p>Working with one piece of chicken at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake off any excess marinade. Dredge the chicken in the breadcrumbs. Use your hands to gently press the breadcrumbs onto the chicken.

        Transfer the breaded chicken onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken, making sure there is space between each piece so that they don't steam and get soggy as they bake.</p>

       <li><h3>Bake the chicken</h3></li>
       <p>Generously spray the chicken with cooking spray. Bake it for 20 minutes. Then gently flip the chicken over, being careful not to peel off the breading, and bake for 10 more minutes. 

        The breading should be a light golden brown; it may have a few darker spots. When cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should register 165°F.</p>

       <li><h3>Make the hot honey</h3></li>
       <p>While the chicken bakes, set a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter, garlic, and jalapeños. Cook until the jalapeños soften, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the paprika, cayenne, and a pinch of salt. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring continuously. Stir in the honey and vinegar. Give it a taste and add more cayenne or paprika, if desired. Remove the hot honey from the heat.

        Let the sauce sit for 5 minutes. You can either strain the hot honey through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl or serve it as is.</p>

       <li><h3>Coat the chicken with hot honey</h3></li>
       <p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer the chicken onto a wire rack so that the bottoms don't get soggy if not serving right away. Right before serving, spoon the hot honey over it to lightly coat. Serve warm with extra hot honey on the side. 

        Refrigerate leftovers for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze the chicken tightly covered for up to 3 months. Reheat leftover in a 400°F oven until warmed through.</p>
