    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Coconut Pound Cake</strong>, it comes together with just a few simple ingredients: flour, butter, sugar,
        sour cream, and unsweetened shredded coconut and coconut milk for a boost of coconutty flavor. Plus, you can mix
        the batter in just one bowl with a spoon.

        It turns out deliciously moist with a tender crumb. It’s nice and dense, as all pound cakes should be, yet
        pillowy soft. It’s not overly sweet—perfect with a cup of coffee, topped with a scoop of ice cream, or just as
        is. Serve it for a special occasion or have it out on the counter for your family to enjoy throughout the week.

        <li>3/4 cup (170g) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (58ml) water, at room temperature </li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (185g) all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (43g) unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (30g) powdered sugar, plus more for dusting </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon water, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 350°F</h3></li>
        <p>Lightly grease with butter then line a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.</p>

        <li><h3>Melt the butter and process the coconut</h3></li>
        <p>In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the butter. Microwave for 20 seconds, then in 10-second increments until melted, stirring after each time. Set it aside to cool a little. 

            In a blender or food processor, add the shredded coconut and sugar. Blend or process for 15 seconds until the coconut looks finely ground. You may need to blitz it a few more times.</p>

        <li><h3>Combine the wet ingredients</h3></li>
        <p>In a large bowl, add the melted butter, blitzed coconut and sugar, sour cream, coconut milk, eggs, and 1/4 cup water, and whisk until fully combined.</p>

        <li><h3>Add the dry ingredients</h3></li>
        <p>Use a sifter or set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl to sift the flour, baking powder, and salt right on top of the wet ingredients.

            Gently whisk the batter until just combined, being careful not to overmix or stir too vigorously.</p>

        <li><h3>Bake the coconut pound cake</h3></li>
        <p>Use a rubber spatula to scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.</p>

        <li><h3>Cool the coconut pound cake</h3></li>
        <p>Transfer the pan onto a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 325°F to make the topping while the cake cools. Tip the coconut pound cake out of the pan, and carefully peel off the parchment paper. Allow it to fully cool on the wire rack. </p>

        <li><h3>Toast the coconut</h3></li>
        <p>On a foil-lined baking sheet, evenly spread 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Bake it for 3 minutes at 325°F, then stir it around and spread it out again. Bake it for 1 to 2 more minutes until toasted and golden brown. Remove it from the oven and let it cool a bit on the baking sheet.</p>

        <li><h3>Decorate the cooled cake</h3></li>
        <p>In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon water. The glaze should be a little runny, so add more water as needed. Use a pastry brush to brush the top of the cake with the glaze. Sprinkle the toasted coconut evenly over the cake. Dust the tops with more powdered sugar, if you’d like.

            Store the pound cake at room temperature in an airtight container or tightly covered with foil. The cake with keep on your kitchen counter for 4 to 5 days.</p>
